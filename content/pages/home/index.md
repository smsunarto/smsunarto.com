# Hi there, I’m Scott.

I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying EECS. Currently, I'm building **[Lattice](https://lattice.xyz)** 

I helped create **[Dark Forest](https://twitter.com/darkforest_eth)**, worked as a security engineer at **[Trail of Bits](https://trailofbits.com)**, and interned at **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org)**.

On the side, I angel invest in founders I like and my smart friends.

One week before I started university, I got a job offer to work full-time as a software engineer. Subsequently, I withdrew from college before the first day of class, cancelled my flights, and decided to take a gap year. In that chapter of my life, I worked as a software engineer at a cryptocurrency exchange in Asia and was also a part of the founding engineering team of **[LandX](https://landx.id)**, Indonesia’s largest equity crowdfunding platform.

At my free time, I’m an amateur cook with a soft spot for Chinese and Japanese cuisines.
